# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn for Vodafone. The project leverages data-driven insights to identify customers at risk of leaving the network and supports proactive retention strategies.

# Key Features
1. Data Extraction & Preprocessing: Pulled and cleaned data from a remote SQL database for analysis and modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify patterns and factors influencing churn.
3. Dataset Balancing: Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address class imbalance.
4. Feature Engineering: Engineered and scaled features to enhance model performance.
5. Model Training & Optimization: Trained multiple supervised machine learning models and optimized them using hyperparameter tuning.
